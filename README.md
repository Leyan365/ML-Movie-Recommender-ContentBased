# 🎬 ML-Movie-Recommender-ContentBased

An End-to-End Movie Recommender System built using **Content-Based Filtering**, **TF-IDF Vectorization**, and deployed with **Streamlit**. The system recommends movies by analyzing metadata such as keywords, genres, cast, crew (director), and plot overview.

---

## 🔑 Features

- 🎯 Recommends top 5 similar movies using content-based filtering
- 🧠 Uses TF-IDF and cosine similarity for similarity scoring
- 🖼️ Fetches real-time movie posters via TMDB API
- ⚙️ Built using pandas, scikit-learn, nltk, Streamlit, and requests
- 🚀 Clean Streamlit UI with a responsive layout and loading spinner

## 🚀 How to Run the Project Locally

> ⚠️ This project does **not** include large datasets or `.pkl` files in the repository. You must generate them before running the app.

### 1. 📦 Setup Environment

This project was developed and tested on Python 3.13.7.
Older versions (e.g., < 3.8) may encounter compatibility issues.

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn streamlit requests nltk
```

---

### 2. 📁 Obtain Datasets

Download the **TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset**:

- [`tmdb_5000_movies.csv`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)
- [`tmdb_5000_credits.csv`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)

📌 Place both CSV files in your project root directory.

---

### 3. ⚙️ Generate Model Artifacts

Open and run all cells in `notebook.ipynb` to:

- Clean and preprocess data
- Perform TF-IDF vectorization
- Compute cosine similarity matrix

This will generate two key files:

- `movies.pkl` – cleaned movie metadata with tags
- `similarity.pkl` – cosine similarity matrix (4806x4806) (Although TF-IDF vectorization used max_features=5000, the final number of unique movie entries after data cleaning was 4806 — hence the similarity matrix is of shape (4806, 4806))

---

### 4. 🔐 Configure TMDB API Key

The app fetches movie posters using the TMDB API.

- Create a free TMDB account → [https://www.themoviedb.org/](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
- Navigate to [API section](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) and generate a **v3 API key**
- Replace the placeholder in `app.py`:

```python
url = f"https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/{movie_id}?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE&language=en-US"
```

> ✅ Don’t commit your real API key to GitHub. Use a placeholder when pushing!

---

### 5. 🚀 Run the App

Launch the Streamlit web app using:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🧠 Technical Deep Dive

### Machine Learning Pipeline (`notebook.ipynb`)

| Step | Description | Libraries |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Data Cleaning** | Merged movies and credits data, handled nulls, parsed genres/keywords/cast/crew | `pandas`, `ast` |
| **Feature Engineering** | Extracted top 3 cast, director, keywords, etc. into a `tags` field | `lambda`, `apply` |
| **Text Normalization** | Used stemming to reduce words to root form | `nltk.PorterStemmer` |
| **Vectorization** | TF-IDF vectorizer on `tags` column (max_features=5000) | `TfidfVectorizer` |
| **Similarity Calculation** | Cosine similarity on vectorized tags | `cosine_similarity` |
| **Artifact Saving** | Saved `movies.pkl` and `similarity.pkl` | `pickle` |

---

### Streamlit App (`app.py`)

- Loads the `.pkl` artifacts
- Accepts user movie input via dropdown
- Finds top 5 similar movies using cosine similarity
- Fetches posters using TMDB API
- Displays results in a horizontal layout with images and captions
- Uses a loading spinner to improve UX
